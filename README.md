# Haskell playground

This directory contains the Vagrant setup of an Ubuntu 14.04 machine
with Stackage's `stack` installed, as a playground for the writing of
Haskell programs.

Haskell programs written using this system must be invoked through the
`stack` command. Note that there is no system `ghc` in this
installation!
